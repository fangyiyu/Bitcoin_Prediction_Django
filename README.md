## Intro

This is a time series analysis project deployed with Django which gives users access to predicting Bitcoin price in a specific time period. The backend machine learning algorithm is Facebook [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), and frontend made with Javascript (Jquery), Html5 and Css3. Considering confidence intervals, three predicted values are generated for the chosen date. In this case, users can compare the predicted price, the interactive graph of historical bitcoin price, and their buying price (if possible) to make trading decisions. 

## Structure of the Django Project

 ## Data
- The real-time bitcoin price chart in the homepage is from [Bitcoin.com API](https://developer.bitcoin.com/bitcoincom-link/docs/getting-started). 
- The data fed to the machine learning model for forecasting is fetched from [Binance API](https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- In views.py, a Graph view is created to pass the graph generated by Plotly to index.html; a predict view is created to pass the predicted values from the Forecasting model to the Html files. Furthermore, Index, logout_view, login_view, and register views are created for user authentication. 

## Run the application locally
- Create a virtual environment by ``` virtualenv <my_env_name>```
- Activate the env by ```<my_env_name>/bin/activate```
- Clone my Repo by ``` git clone <the https of the repo>```
- Get into the dir where manage.py is by ```cd pred_bitcoin_v2```
- Install required packages by ``` pip install -r requirements.txt```. This step may take a while, since the pystan and prophet packages may take approximately up to three minutes. You may encounter "Failed building wheel for prophet", but the package will ultimately been installed.
- Make migrations by ``` python3 manage.py makemigrations```, then ``` python3 manage.py migrate```
- Run the application by ``` python3 manage.py runserver```


## Deployment
I have deployed the applicaiton on Heroku, and here is the live [demo](https://predbit.herokuapp.com/).
